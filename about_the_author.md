### **About the Author**

Mikita Kavaliou is a systems thinker and a relentless investigator of the hidden rules that govern human interaction. He spent the first part of his career as a programmer, where he grew fascinated by the contrast between the elegant logic of code and the often-unpredictable "bugs" of human communication.

Driven by the question, "What's the source code?", Mikita embarked on a years-long deep dive into the worlds of social neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and behavioral economics. He discovered that the principles for debugging a complex system were surprisingly applicable to debugging a difficult conversation.

This book is the result of that investigation. It is the user's manual he wishes he'd had twenty years ago. Today, he works with leaders and teams at some of the world's most innovative companies, teaching them how to trade guesswork for neuroscience and become the confident "conductors" of their professional and personal lives.
