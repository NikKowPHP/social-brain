### **About the Author**

Mikita Kavaliou is a systems thinker and a relentless investigator of the hidden rules that govern human interaction. He spent the first part of his career as a programmer, where he grew fascinated by the contrast between the elegant logic of code and the often-unpredictable "bugs" of human communication.

After a humiliating boardroom experience where a good story easily defeated his perfect data, Mikita embarked on a decade-long investigation to find the "source code" of influence and connection. This journey led him deep into the worlds of social neuroscience and cognitive psychology, where he developed **The Conductor Method™**—a powerful, science-backed system for mastering high-stakes communication.

Today, Mikita is a sought-after keynote speaker and advisor who teaches The Conductor Method™ to leaders and teams at the world's most innovative companies. This book is the result of his investigation, a user's manual for the social brain he wishes he'd had twenty years ago.
