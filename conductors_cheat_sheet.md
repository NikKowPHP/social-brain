### **The Conductor's Cheat Sheet**

**The 3 Brains (Your Orchestra Sections)**
*   **Architect:** Logic, data, structure. (Can seem cold).
*   **Connector:** Empathy, harmony, relationship. (Can avoid conflict).
*   **Sentinel:** Threat detection, risk, safety. (Can be overactive).

**The 5 SCARF Domains (The Brain's Social Radar)**
*   **Status:** Importance, rank, being valued.
*   **Certainty:** Clarity, predictability, knowing the future.
*   **Autonomy:** Control, choice, agency.
*   **Relatedness:** Friend vs. Foe, belonging, in-group safety.
*   **Fairness:** Equity, just exchanges, transparency.

**Core Protocols & Tools**
*   **The Conductor's Breath (Chapter 3):** Double inhale through the nose, long exhale through the mouth. (Manual override for an amygdala hijack).
*   **The Empathy Loop (Chapter 4):**
    1.  **The Switch:** Ask an open "What" or "How" question (e.g., "What's the hardest part of this for you?").
    2.  **The Playback:** Summarize the underlying emotion you heard (e.g., "So it sounds like you felt invisible.").
*   **The Trust Protocol (Chapter 6):**
    *   Execute **Calibrated Vulnerability**: Share a small, professional vulnerability and observe the response.
*   **The Clarity Protocol (Chapter 7):**
    1.  **One Goal Per Message.**
    2.  **Headline First** (state your request immediately).
    3.  **Chunk the Details** (use bullets, bolding, short paragraphs).
*   **The Tension & Resolution Arc (Chapter 8):**
    *   **And...** (The stable situation).
    *   **But...** (The problem/tension).
    *   **Therefore...** (Your idea as the solution).
*   **The Feedback Protocols (Chapter 11):**
    *   **Giving (Debug):** 1. Get Permission. 2. Share Data, Not Drama. 3. Co-Create Solution.
    *   **Receiving (Intake):** 1. Regulate (Breathe). 2. Resist Defending. 3. Ask for Data ("Can you give an example?").

**Emergency Protocol: The Hijack (Chapter 9)**
*When a conversation catches fire:*
1.  **Regulate Yourself First** (Conductor's Breath).
2.  **Validate the Feeling, Not the Content** (Use The Playback).
3.  **Restore Autonomy** (Give them a choice, e.g., "Should we pause for five minutes?").
