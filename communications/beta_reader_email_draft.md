**Subject: Beta Read: The Conductor Method Manuscript**

Hi everyone,

Thank you so much for agreeing to be a story-focused beta reader for my book, *The Conductor Method*. Your willingness to lend me your time and attention at this stage is an incredible gift, and I'm deeply grateful.

Attached, you'll find the complete manuscript.

As a reminder, my main goal for this round of feedback is to understand your emotional journey as a reader. I'm less concerned with the scientific details and more interested in whether the story of Maria and her team resonates, feels believable, and is emotionally compelling.

To guide your read-through, I've attached a separate document, `BETA_READER_QUESTIONS.md`, which has the specific questions I'm hoping you can help me answer. Please feel free to make notes directly in the manuscript or answer the questions separatelyâ€”whatever is easiest for you.

I would be so grateful to receive your feedback by **[Date, e.g., November 15th, 2025]**. This will give me enough time to incorporate your invaluable insights before the next revision.

Thank you again for being a part of this process. I can't wait to hear what you think.

All the best,

Mikita
