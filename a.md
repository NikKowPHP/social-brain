    The user wants to rewrite `chapters/chapter-2.md` to be an active scene rather than a summary of events. This will make the chapter more engaging by showing Maria's reaction to her conflict with Mark and the arrival of the urgent email, rather than simply telling the reader about it.

    My plan is to:
    1.  Modify `chapters/chapter-2.md`, replacing the existing content with a new version that follows the user's "show, don't tell" directive. The new scene will depict Maria in the immediate aftermath of her call with Mark, her visceral reaction to the urgent email, and the crystallization of her new, high-stakes problem.
    2.  Update `TASKS.md` by adding a new item for this task and marking it as complete.

### **Chapter 2: The Conductor's Challenge**

The video call ended, but Mark's face—a frozen mask of anger—was seared onto Maria's screen. She dropped her head into her hands, the silence of her office amplifying the frantic drumming in her chest.

*"This needs a lot of work."*

Her own words echoed in her mind, clinical and brutal. She had treated her best engineer like a bug in her code. Her expertise in logic and structure—her greatest professional strength—had become her biggest liability in human interaction.

*What am I missing?* she wrote on a fresh page of her notebook, the question a raw admission of failure. *There are rules to this system, but I don't know what they are.*

This was the conductor's blind spot. Before you can fix a system, you must understand it. Her investigation had to begin.

Just as she was starting to process the depth of her leadership challenge, a notification banner flashed across her screen. The subject line hit her like a physical blow:

**Subject: URGENT: Sterling Corp. Technical Review Moved Up.**

Her blood ran cold. The review—a single, high-stakes meeting where the client's CTO would decide the fate of their nine-figure contract—was now in six weeks. The clock was officially ticking.

The Phoenix Project, her career-defining initiative, was no longer just a mission; it was a race against time. And she had just alienated her best engineer.

The dual pressures—a looming professional deadline and a fractured team relationship—crystallized her problem into a single, sharp point of focus. Her old way of leading, the one built on pure logic and efficiency, was not just ineffective; it was now a direct threat to the project's survival.

She looked from the email to the note she had just written. *What am I missing?* The question was no longer a philosophical one. It was a tactical imperative. To have any chance of success, she needed a new toolkit, a new way of conducting. Her investigation into the source code of human connection had just become the most important project of her career.
