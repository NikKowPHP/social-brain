### **Questions for Story-Focused Beta Readers**

Thank you for reading this manuscript. Your feedback is crucial for making the story at the heart of this book as compelling as the science.

Please read with the following questions in mind. Don't worry about the scientific details or the specific tools being taught. My only goal with this feedback is to understand your emotional journey as a reader.

**Character & Connection:**

*   Did you root for Maria? Why or why not?
*   When, if ever, did you feel frustrated with her?
*   Was her transformation believable? Did it feel earned?
*   Were you angry at David? Was he a believable antagonist or a caricature?
*   Which secondary character did you connect with the most (Mark, Jane, Leo)? Why?

**Emotional Arc:**

*   What was the single most emotional moment in the book for you? (This could be a moment of tension, frustration, triumph, or connection).
*   Was there a moment where you felt a sense of victory or relief for Maria and her team?
*   Was there a moment where you felt her failure or disappointment most keenly?
*   Did the ending of Maria's story feel satisfying?

**Pacing & Engagement:**

*   Was there any point where you felt bored or that the story was dragging?
*   Was there any point where you were confused about what was happening or why?
*   Did the story of Maria and her team make you want to keep reading to find out what happened next?

Thank you for your invaluable contribution to this process.
