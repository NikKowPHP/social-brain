### **Join the Orchestra**

Our investigation in this book is complete, but the practice of becoming a conductor is a lifelong journey. The most effective conductors don't practice in isolation; they learn from the entire orchestra.

If you are committed to applying **The Conductor Methodâ„¢** in your life and leadership, I invite you to join our community of practice. Visit **[AuthorWebsite.com/community]** to access bonus materials, including a video walkthrough of the SCARF model, and connect with other leaders who are also learning to conduct.

Let's continue the investigation together.
