### **Join the Orchestra**

This book was an investigation into the rules of human connection, but the investigation is never truly over. The community is where this work continues.

It's a space to ask the questions that came up for you while reading, to share the messy, imperfect results of your own experiments, and to learn from other conductors who are on the same journey. The book is the map; the community is the territory.

If you wish to continue the exploration, you are welcome. The conversation is happening at **[AuthorWebsite.com/community]**.
