### **Part II: The Toolkit - Mastering the Core Performances**

### **Chapter 5: Your Toolkit Map & Cheat Sheet**

*(A note to the designer: This chapter is intended to be a single, full-page visual infographicâ€”the master blueprint for the Conductor's toolkit. It should serve as a quick, visual reference that the reader can return to again and again.)*

Welcome to Part II, the heart of your training. In Part I, we built your Conductor's Dashboard. You learned to diagnose the hidden forces in any interaction using SCARF, Brain Profiles, and Social Gravity. Now, in Part II, we will move from diagnosis to practice, building your toolkit one instrument at a time.

This chapter is your map. It provides a high-level overview of the complete system architecture up front to prevent cognitive overload. Refer back to this page whenever you need to see how a specific tool fits into the larger system.
