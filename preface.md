### **A Note for the Non-Programmer**

I learned to understand the world through the logic of code. This book is my journey of applying that same analytical lens to the messy, wonderful world of human connection. At times, I will use the language of systems and code because it is my native tongue. It is how I make sense of things.

But I urge you to see past the words to the universal human principles they describe.

A "bug report" is just a moment of painful misunderstanding.

A "protocol" is simply a mindful, repeatable way to show you care.

An "amygdala hijack" is that awful moment when your emotions get the better of you.

This book is not about turning your family into a computer; it's about discovering the beautiful, predictable patterns that govern love and connection. Whether you are a programmer, a parent, a partner, or a friend, the human brain works in consistent ways. My hope is that my language, while perhaps unfamiliar, will give you a new and powerful way to see the system you are already a part of.
