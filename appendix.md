### **Appendix: For the Curious Brain**

This book has translated complex neuroscience into simple, actionable protocols. For those who, like me, want to see the "source code," this appendix provides a brief overview of the key scientific concepts and researchers whose work underpins our journey.

*   **Social vs. Physical Pain:** The foundational idea that social threats are processed in the same brain regions as physical pain (the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex) was pioneered by neuroscientists like **Dr. Naomi Eisenberger** and **Dr. Matthew Lieberman** at UCLA. Their fMRI studies using the "Cyberball" game, where participants were socially excluded, are landmark works in social neuroscience.
*   **The SCARF Model:** This brilliant synthesis of social neuroscience was developed by **David Rock**. It is a cornerstone of the field of neuroleadership and provides the most practical framework for understanding the five key domains that trigger social threat and reward responses in the brain.
*   **The Amygdala Hijack:** The term was popularized by psychologist and author **Daniel Goleman** in his work on emotional intelligence. It describes the process by which the amygdala, the brain's threat-detector, can "hijack" the prefrontal cortex, leading to a state of emotional reactivity.
*   **Neuroplasticity:** The concept that the brain can physically re-wire itself based on experience and practice is a fundamental principle of modern neuroscience. The work of researchers like **Dr. Michael Merzenich** has shown that focused repetition strengthens synaptic connections and builds myelin, the biological basis of habit and skill formation.
*   **Oxytocin:** Known as the "trust molecule" or "bonding hormone," this neuropeptide's role in social connection has been studied extensively by researchers like **Dr. Paul Zak**. His work demonstrates how oxytocin reduces fear in the amygdala and promotes pro-social behaviors like trust and generosity, particularly toward one's "in-group."
*   **Cognitive Load & Working Memory:** The concept of the severe limitations of working memory was famously articulated by cognitive psychologist **George A. Miller** in his 1956 paper "The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two." While modern research suggests the number is closer to four, the core principle remains a critical hardware limitation of the human brain.
*   **Neural Coupling (Storytelling):** The discovery that a storyteller's and a listener's brains synchronize during a compelling narrative comes from the work of neuroscientist **Uri Hasson** at Princeton. His fMRI studies show how stories are a uniquely powerful "brain-to-brain" data transfer protocol.
