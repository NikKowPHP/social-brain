### **Glossary**

**Amygdala:** An almond-shaped set of neurons located deep in the brain's temporal lobe. It is the primary processing center for emotional reactions, especially fear, and plays a key role in the brain's threat-detection system. (See Chapters 1, 3, 8, 11, 12).

**Amygdala Hijack:** A term popularized by Daniel Goleman for an immediate, overwhelming emotional response that is out of proportion to the stimulus, triggered by the amygdala overriding the rational prefrontal cortex. (See Chapters 1, 11).

**Cognitive Load:** The total amount of mental effort being used in the working memory. Exceeding this limited capacity leads to confusion, overwhelm, and an inability to process new information. (See Chapter 10).

**Dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex (dACC):** A brain region that is activated by both physical pain (e.g., a burn) and social pain (e.g., rejection), providing the neurological link between the two experiences. (See Chapter 3).

**Myelin/Myelination:** A fatty substance that wraps around nerve fibers, acting as an insulator and dramatically increasing the speed and efficiency of neural signals. The process of myelination is the physical basis of skill acquisition and habit formation. (See Chapter 11).

**Neuroplasticity:** The brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life. This allows the brain to adapt, learn, and recover from injury. (See Chapter 11).

**Neurotransmitter/Neuropeptide:** Chemicals that transmit signals between neurons. Key examples in this book include Dopamine (reward, motivation), Cortisol (stress), and Oxytocin (bonding, trust).

**Oxytocin:** A neuropeptide often called the "bonding hormone" or "trust molecule." It is crucial for social bonding, reducing fear in the amygdala, and increasing feelings of trust and generosity toward members of one's "in-group." (See Chapter 8).

**Prefrontal Cortex (PFC):** The front-most part of the brain, responsible for executive functions such as rational thought, planning, impulse control, and understanding others' perspectives. The "CEO" of the brain. (See Chapter 1).

**Psychological Safety:** A shared belief within a team that the environment is safe for interpersonal risk-taking, such as asking questions, admitting mistakes, or offering new ideas without fear of being shamed or punished. (See Chapter 18).

**SCARF Model:** A framework developed by David Rock identifying the five key domains of social experience that the brain treats as life-or-death survival issues: **S**tatus, **C**ertainty, **A**utonomy, **R**elatedness, and **F**airness. (See Chapter 5).

**Working Memory:** The brain's temporary storage and manipulation space; a "mental workbench" with a very limited capacity (approx. 4-5 items) for holding conscious thoughts. (See Chapter 10).
